Download Visual Studio Code.
Download the code for the app through github: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
You need a virtual device in order to run the code and see what the app looks like.
To set up your virtual device, you need to first download Android Studio. 
After you've downloaded Android Studio, use this Youtube video to set up the virtual device: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRLLjlpy0r4.
After that, you should be able to run the app on the virtual device. Make sure the device is already open before you try to run it.
